1
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:55,800
Last boarding call for flight TF168
from Stockholm to MalmÃ¶.

2
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,480
But that's OK I guess.

3
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:03,080
You make my mom very happy.

4
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:06,720
-A little bit more.
-OK.

5
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:10,560
-Hold the glass.
-Wait wait wait.

6
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:13,400
Is that all I'm getting?

7
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:23,680
And let's pour some...
Oh, damn it!

8
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:27,360
OK, so it's like that today? Hey...

9
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:32,720
Happy birthday.

10
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:35,800
-Oskar?
-Hold on.

11
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,520
-Say something to the camera that describes Lasse.
-Damn.

12
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:43,120
My sis and her boyfriend are running late.

13
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,400
No, no, no. What are they doing?

14
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:54,280
-I think your mom is a bit of a slut.
-Well I think your dad is a horn dog.

15
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:57,360
-Look, it fits perfectly.
-I'll never take it off.

16
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:59,640
You promise?

17
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:04,960
Of course I promise.

18
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:13,320
Can you hold this?
I have to take the luggage.

19
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:32,880
Let's go and grab a cigarette first.

20
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:39,120
It's a bit crooked.

21
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:44,040
Come on, you little muppet.

22
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:54,800
Should I tell dad
or should you do it?

23
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:59,640
No, of course you should tell him.
It's your dad.

24
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:13,000
-I'm sorry. Could I borrow a lighter from you?
-Yes.

25
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:24,160
It's not lit.

26
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:27,040
Frida! damn, there you are. Hi.

27
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:33,880
-Have you been here for a while, or?
-No, we just got here.

28
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:36,280
Have you introduced yourselves?

29
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:38,680
-This is Mia, my sister.
-Frida.

30
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:42,520
And this is Tim, her boyfriend.
- Frida is Elisabeth's daughter.

31
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:46,200
-Oh, OK.
-Well, let's not stand here all day.

32
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:52,040
Thank you so much for that. But above all
I give my sincerest gratitude-

33
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:58,040
-for this fantastic food that
Oskar and Frida have put together.

34
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:02,600
And... I get so nervous
when I speak like this.

35
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:09,320
But it feels quite touching
that you're all here when I'm turning 60-

36
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:14,960
-and above all to celebrate that
Elisabeth and I are getting engaged.

37
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:21,520
But above all, a great thank you
to Elisabeth for saying yes.

38
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:30,080
-Well, look here. Come in. Hi.
-Hi, dad.

39
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:36,560
Another surprise. This is my daughter Mia,
this is... - Hi, Tim. - This is Tim.

40
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:38,800
This is great.

41
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:44,240
Well, now I'm just completely
surrounded by love.

42
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:47,680
And now I'm just going to sit down next to Elisabeth and relax.

43
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:53,680
And let's have a fucking good time tonight, right?

44
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:04,560
Hello.
I think the big gift just arrived.

45
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:09,280
Well, now I'm getting emotional.

46
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:15,320
Mia just told me that she and
Tim are going to get married.

47
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:23,320
Congratulations!

48
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:31,840
Hi, Mia. So good to see you.
Congratulations.

49
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:42,920
Excuse me for just interrupting like this,
but I would also like to say a few words.

50
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:45,640
I'll start with you Lasse.

51
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:50,000
We may not always agree about everything.

52
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:57,200
That's OK too I guess. But above all
you make my mom very happy.

53
00:07:57,400 --> 00:08:02,240
And that's all I care about.
- And mom, you really deserve the best.

54
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:08,280
And we have in some strange way
blended together as a family very quickly.

55
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:11,280
And I am incredibly happy about that.

56
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:13,880
Where are you, Oskar?

57
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:19,440
And I hope things continue like that.

58
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:24,920
And above all that you stay as happy as you seem now.

59
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:29,480
So I would also like to propose a toast - to mom and Lasse.

60
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:37,160
Cheers!

61
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:42,520
-Hip, hip!
-Hooray! Hooray! Hooray! Hooray!

62
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:47,280
Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday to you

63
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:51,520
Happy birthday dear Lasse

64
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:55,840
Elisabeth seems lovely.

65
00:08:57,640 --> 00:09:00,440
Elisabeth is amazing.

66
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:07,440
-I know you're going to like her.
-You seem like you're well, Dad.

67
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:12,520
I'm great.

68
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:20,720
Can't we go for a walk tomorrow morning,
like we used to?

69
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:23,680
When I was little, you mean?

70
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:59,560
-What are you doing? Are you flirting with her?
-What?

71
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:05,280
-With who?
-With Frida of course. You seem to enjoy each other's company anyway.

72
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:08,560
Well, I didn't get any on the plane.

73
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:13,440
-Good morning. Is it free?
-Sure, just go in.

74
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:18,320
-Dad?
-Hey, I think they're still asleep.

75
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:42,960
Hi. Should we go for a walk then?
- Hi Tim. Thank you for yesterday.

76
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:46,440
I thought we were getting together this morning.

77
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:51,520
-Are you sulking now?
-No, I'm not sulking.

78
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:55,920
I think you're sulking.
- Tim, she's sulking, right?

79
00:11:56,120 --> 00:12:01,600
She is definitely sulking. Mia sulks
when Mia doesn't get what Mia wants.

80
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:07,160
I was going to ask you to come along to Fyn tomorrow
and give us advice on a house extension.

81
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:10,880
-But I realize it's the wrong time.
-No, I would love to do it.

82
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:14,240
As long as I get some time alone with you.
We have barely seen each other yet.

83
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:17,000
Of course.

84
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:20,320
-Bye.
-Bye.

85
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:28,160
Guys, how about a toast?

86
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:32,320
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

87
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:45,160
-Tim, how's the company doing?
-It's doing pretty well actually.

88
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:50,000
It's always tough the first few years,
but I think-

89
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:54,800
-with time it will go really well.

90
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:58,880
We just received a huge project.

91
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:03,000
Great, congratulations.

92
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:05,760
And when will I become a grandfather?

93
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:09,120
-Stop nagging, Dad.
-Yes, we're in no rush.

94
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:13,720
Well, don't wait too long. I don't want
to be in a home when he or she comes along.

95
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:17,160
Lasse! Time to take it down a notch, don't you think?

96
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:23,280
Thank you Elisabeth. Why should all the pressure be on me?
Frida might beat me to it.

97
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:25,440
Right?

98
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:30,880
Yes, absolutely!

99
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:35,440
-Where are you going for your honeymoon then, Mia?
-I don't know.

100
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:41,160
I haven't even found a dress yet.
So I haven't had time to think about it yet.

101
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:46,840
I was actually thinking about wearing mom's dress.
If you don't mind.

102
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:50,200
Not at all, darling.

103
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:53,120
Why would I?

104
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:05,280
-Mia is nothing like I thought.
-No?

105
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:09,360
Did you think she would be more like Oskar?

106
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:12,000
Maybe.

107
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:17,200
-Mia is more like her mother.
-Is everything OK between the two of you?

108
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:22,800
Why do you ask?

109
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:26,720
Doesn't it seem to be?

110
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:36,520
Dad really didn't like that thing
about the dress. Did you notice?

111
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:42,040
Maybe you should listen to him.

112
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:53,360
Stop filming.
I'm not up for it.

113
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:00,840
-Did you cheat?
-God, you're so curious.

114
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:05,560
-Did you?
-No, I've never cheated and I never will.

115
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:10,240
-I can't think of anything worse.
-Same here.

116
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:15,440
Especially considering how Dad's been at it.
It's like sis says. We inherited Mom's faithful genes.

117
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:19,360
-That's good.
-It feels different now that he's met Elisabeth.

118
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:23,400
-Does it?
-Sure, he's so calm.

119
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:30,960
And by the way,
you might have kids before Mia and Tim.

120
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:33,440
God, you're so sweet.

121
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:39,680
Mia is lucky to have you.
You're like, the best baby brother ever.

122
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:42,360
I'm just trying to do my job.

123
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:51,080
What do you mean, I should listen to him?
Don't you like the dress?

124
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:56,880
Honestly.
It's an ugly 70's dress.

125
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:04,840
What does it matter? What is
so important to you about that dress?

126
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:11,280
I don't know. I've always
liked it since I was little.

127
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:16,000
I've always told mom
I'm going to wear it when I get married.

128
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:24,800
I just want our wedding
to be as perfect as possible.

129
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:30,160
I just want us to be happy.
I don't want some dress or your dad to ruin that.

130
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:35,480
OK?

131
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:12,160
-I thinks she's awesome.
-I noticed. Maybe you should go instead of me.

132
00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:15,040
I don't have the time. I have to work.

133
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:20,000
-Can't we buy one of those too?
-Absolutely.

134
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:27,200
OK. I'll call you
when I get there. Bye.

135
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:46,360
Oh good, it's Aston's, he's one of my students.
You can just toss it in the back.

136
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:58,920
I know it's none of my business,
but I have to ask.

137
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:01,480
Sure, just ask.

138
00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:08,440
Oskar and you...
Are you together or something?

139
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:14,480
-What?
-I don't know, I just think it's a bit...

140
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:21,600
What business is it of yours? Is it the age difference?
I'm a few years older than him, is that it?

141
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:26,040
Excuse me. What business is it of mine?
We'll soon be in the same family.

142
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:29,120
Don't you think that's a bit...

143
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:34,360
No but, come on, we don't even have the same parents.
You make it sound like total inbreeding.

144
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:46,640
But I have to say - your
little brother is insanely good in bed.

145
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:53,320
-Oh my God, I don't want to hear that!
-What? But he is.

146
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:19,080
-You were joking about you and Oskar of course?
-Well, yes.

147
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:25,240
I couldn't resist teasing you.
You seem so anal.

148
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:30,360
Oh God, I'm sorry, I didn't mean...

149
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:35,560
-I didn't mean anal that way. Not "anal" anal.
-It's OK.

150
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:49,200
Oskar said it's been a while
since you've been home to visit.

151
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:52,560
-Yes, since last Christmas.
-OK.

152
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:59,480
Well, Lasse seems a bit, it feels like
he's a bit different when you're at home.

153
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:06,720
I'm sorry, it might be because I'm so anal, but
it's been a while since I felt this analysed by someone.

154
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:12,720
No God, I didn't mean to analyse.
It was...It was an observation.

155
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:07,440
You, well... I'm sorry for what happened on the ferry,
that I was so...

156
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:11,400
-Charmless?
-Yes, exactly.

157
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:16,200
Mia? Would you come out here for a moment?

158
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:19,160
Raspberry?

159
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:29,920
I was thinking about having an extension here.

160
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:35,640
Maybe a guesthouse
with a glass porch maybe?

161
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:39,120
-What do you think?
-Yes, that would probably be pretty nice.

162
00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:43,840
You could build a cube there...

163
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:46,960
...with a glass porch with a view of the forest, for example.

164
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:49,680
Where is dad anyway?

165
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:55,040
He had an emergency meeting in town.

166
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:59,640
-So he's not coming?
-No. He didn't tell you?

167
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:04,600
-No.
-Well, it turned out a little weird.

168
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:12,200
Iâll go inside and start making dinner,
and you and Frida can unpack. Weâll eat soon.

169
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:30,560
Hi, this is Lasse SundstrÃ¶m.
Leave a message and I'll call you back. Thanks, bye.

170
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:37,000
Damn it, Dad. You can't just not show up
and leave me alone on a deserted island in the middle of nowhere.

171
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:41,440
Damn it, I don't know these people.

172
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:45,120
Thank you so bloody much!

173
00:22:57,640 --> 00:22:59,840
Well. Where is Mia then?

174
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:02,760
I don't know. I can go look.

175
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:06,920
Bring a flashlight. Maybe she got lost.
She's from the city.

176
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:09,960
She was going to make a phone call.

177
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:14,240
-I know she can be difficult to get to know.
-You don't say?

178
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:17,000
Well, you'll be nice to her won't you?

179
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:21,840
I know! Here. Bring some wine and cigarettes.
Here you go.

180
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:26,440
-What do you mean, nice? I'm always nice.
-Now go.

181
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,480
So this is where you're hiding?

182
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:42,520
-Do you want some wine?
-Please.

183
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:53,360
Have you ever been married?

184
00:23:55,480 --> 00:23:57,400
No.

185
00:23:57,600 --> 00:24:01,560
The closest I ever came
was an engagement that lasted-

186
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:06,720
-for exactly 5 months,
three weeks and two days.

187
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:09,280
What happened?

188
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:15,360
I discovered I was engaged
to someone I didn't know.

189
00:24:15,560 --> 00:24:20,920
-I thought I did, but I didn't.
-Did he stop turning your world upside down?

190
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:24,320
No, I don't know if I've ever
met anyone like that.

191
00:24:24,520 --> 00:24:27,600
I'm not sure I would want
someone to do that to me.

192
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:35,280
Thank you.

193
00:24:57,280 --> 00:25:02,080
I can't believe you seriously thought
I was together with Oskar.

194
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:08,600
-Why? I don't know you.
-No, but you're funny. I like that.

195
00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:20,720
Come on, I'll show you something.

196
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:30,000
I think they should be somewhere around here.

197
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:36,600
Look.

198
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:58,600
There's more coffee, if you want.

199
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:05,160
-Hey.
-No thank you.

200
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:22,640
Yes, I was wondering if you have car rental..

201
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:26,920
OK.

202
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:31,640
So there is no other way
of getting off the island?

203
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:35,560
Yes, OK. Thanks a lot. Bye.

204
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:40,000
-Damn!
-Mia! Do you want to come fishing?

205
00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:27,440
Why did you kiss me?

206
00:30:33,320 --> 00:30:36,960
We can't pretend
that it didn't happen.

207
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:55,680
So. Ready to leave?

208
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:32,840
We're going swimming.
We'll be back later.

209
00:31:56,640 --> 00:32:01,240
-So, you like...?
-Girls. Yes.

210
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:04,840
You didn't know?

211
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:10,600
Why did you kiss me?

212
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:13,320
I don't know.

213
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:17,160
I...I just did.

214
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:23,680
-Is this stressing you out?
-I love Tim.

215
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:28,880
I get that, but a person can be attracted to several people.

216
00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:32,080
Attracted to?

217
00:32:32,280 --> 00:32:34,920
You, I'm not like you.

218
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:37,920
OK.

219
00:32:40,560 --> 00:32:45,920
-Are you sure?
-Of course I'm sure.

220
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:14,720
-Did something happen?
-No.

221
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:22,920
No, I'm just tired.

222
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:33,160
Hi! Good morning. Sleep well?

223
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:37,880
Let's leave then.

224
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,560
So. Let's see here then...

225
00:40:16,120 --> 00:40:19,400
-What is this, Frida?
-Take it easy, mom.

226
00:40:19,600 --> 00:40:23,920
It's a sensitive engine.
It takes a while for it to start up.

227
00:40:31,240 --> 00:40:34,400
Frida how many times have I told you
to ask someone to look at this car?

228
00:40:34,600 --> 00:40:38,440
I know that Mom.
But you telling me doesn't help.

229
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:41,880
It won't start because you're telling me.

230
00:40:46,120 --> 00:40:50,480
We'll have to take the bus.
We'll miss the ferry if we don't.

231
00:40:50,680 --> 00:40:55,520
We can make this bus if we go now.
It's just as well, we'll just walk.

232
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:17,520
56 people already RSPV'd to the e-mail about the wedding.

233
00:41:40,600 --> 00:41:43,160
Have you got everything?

234
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:47,800
-Did something happen, or what?
-No.

235
00:42:14,080 --> 00:42:16,240
Are you angry with me?

236
00:42:19,160 --> 00:42:24,640
I like you so much, Frida.
But it's a mess right now, you understand?

237
00:42:25,360 --> 00:42:28,480
I get that.

238
00:42:29,640 --> 00:42:33,520
But I'm right here.
You can talk to me.

239
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:37,720
Frida, I love Tim.

240
00:42:42,120 --> 00:42:44,680
I don't believe that.

241
00:42:45,800 --> 00:42:49,160
We have a whole life together.

242
00:42:49,360 --> 00:42:52,320
I know you feel something for me.

243
00:42:54,360 --> 00:42:59,200
I'm going to marry Tim in a few months.
I can't feel this way about you, don't you get that?

244
00:43:00,440 --> 00:43:02,800
It's impossible.

245
00:43:22,440 --> 00:43:26,040
Then I guess you'll have to stay with him.

246
00:43:46,560 --> 00:43:51,240
OK... I just wanted you to get to know each other.

247
00:43:51,440 --> 00:43:54,320
It may have been stupid.

248
00:43:54,520 --> 00:44:00,280
I'm here to see you, Dad.
I wanted to show you what I've been doing at work.

249
00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:04,520
-Talk to you about the wedding. Don't you see I need to do that?
-Sure, just talk.

250
00:44:04,720 --> 00:44:07,920
Can't you focus on that?
Pull it tighter.

251
00:44:08,120 --> 00:44:10,840
Come on, pull it.

252
00:44:12,880 --> 00:44:15,520
Come on! Harder!

253
00:44:21,120 --> 00:44:26,680
Are you still serious about wearing Mom's dress to the wedding?
The most important day of your life?

254
00:44:27,320 --> 00:44:32,200
-If it's meant as a gibe at me I don't think it's worth it.
-What are you talking about?

255
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:37,320
I know you think it's my fault that Mom and I got divorced.
But we were both in it.

256
00:44:37,520 --> 00:44:42,360
Yes. But only one of you was fucking her best friend
and lying about it! Right?

257
00:44:42,560 --> 00:44:47,680
Why do you always have to take her side?
We had problems long before that.

258
00:44:47,880 --> 00:44:51,600
OK. What does that have to do with the dress?
Why do you think it's a gibe?

259
00:44:51,800 --> 00:44:57,880
-Listen. Me being unfaithful...
-I don't want to hear about your fucking infidelity, don't you get it?!

260
00:44:58,080 --> 00:45:01,120
-OK, I get it, I get it.
-Hasn't it done enough damage to this family already?

261
00:45:01,320 --> 00:45:04,960
I get it.
Should we put up the net now or what?

262
00:45:06,400 --> 00:45:10,600
-Are we playing or not?
-No!

263
00:45:10,800 --> 00:45:15,200
-I did this for your sake.
-Hey! Time to eat!

264
00:45:15,400 --> 00:45:17,360
Yes!

265
00:45:19,280 --> 00:45:22,040
Pull a bit harder now!

266
00:45:24,200 --> 00:45:29,400
I think it was damn selfish of you to just not show up out at the cottage.

267
00:45:29,600 --> 00:45:32,960
-This damn nagging.
-Nagging?

268
00:45:34,280 --> 00:45:38,560
But you get along so well with Frida...

269
00:45:48,360 --> 00:45:52,160
Can I have the salad? Thank you.

270
00:45:53,520 --> 00:45:57,760
-Anyone want some bread?
-Thank you, I'm good.

271
00:45:59,960 --> 00:46:06,040
-Mia, did you tell them we're looking for a house?
-That's nice. What a great investment.

272
00:46:06,920 --> 00:46:10,560
Well, we've been looking for something small.

273
00:46:10,760 --> 00:46:14,840
Maybe to expand later.

274
00:46:15,080 --> 00:46:19,360
-Well, we've been looking for something small
-Eh, no...

275
00:46:19,560 --> 00:46:24,920
We looked at a few places,
but there hasn't been anything that interesting.

276
00:46:26,080 --> 00:46:28,640
I can't, I...

277
00:46:28,840 --> 00:46:31,480
I can't...

278
00:46:35,200 --> 00:46:41,200
...stay here. I had a kebab
earlier and I don't feel well.

279
00:46:41,400 --> 00:46:46,720
-I'll take the car I think. Home.
-Kebab? When did you start eating meat?

280
00:46:48,720 --> 00:46:51,840
No, it was one of these...

281
00:46:52,080 --> 00:46:56,320
It was...a vegetarian kebab.

282
00:46:57,360 --> 00:47:00,280
-A vebab.
-A vebab?

283
00:47:02,520 --> 00:47:07,400
-Exactly.
-What's that? Isn't meat the point of kebab?

284
00:47:08,880 --> 00:47:12,560
-Or tofu.
-That doesn't sound good at all.

285
00:47:13,640 --> 00:47:18,280
But Frida, you've had lots of wine.
We'll call you a taxi.

286
00:47:18,960 --> 00:47:21,760
-I can drive you.
-It's OK...

287
00:47:21,960 --> 00:47:27,080
Why would you stuff yourself with vebab when you're not craving meat?
It's stuff like that I don't get.

288
00:47:27,280 --> 00:47:33,160
No, well... You don't always get everything Lasse.

289
00:48:24,960 --> 00:48:26,920
Hello?

290
00:48:27,880 --> 00:48:29,840
Hi!

291
00:48:32,640 --> 00:48:37,560
God, I missed you.
I made dinner. Come on.

292
00:48:40,880 --> 00:48:46,640
What is it? Did I misunderstand
about the dress?

293
00:48:46,840 --> 00:48:48,800
What?

294
00:48:50,560 --> 00:48:55,400
Did something happen?
Is everything OK between you and Tim?

295
00:48:56,440 --> 00:48:59,200
Did you have a fight?

296
00:49:01,040 --> 00:49:06,200
Mom and I also fought a lot
when we were about to get married.

297
00:49:10,640 --> 00:49:14,280
It's nerves.

298
00:49:14,480 --> 00:49:18,600
It's nothing, Dad.
It's just...

299
00:49:21,560 --> 00:49:25,200
Can't you tell me what's going on?

300
00:49:25,400 --> 00:49:28,280
I'm just a bit tired.

301
00:49:31,960 --> 00:49:34,160
Hey, tomorrow...

302
00:49:35,200 --> 00:49:38,640
...why don't you show me your drafts.

303
00:49:38,840 --> 00:49:42,440
And we can spend all day together.

304
00:49:44,840 --> 00:49:47,200
Would you like that?

305
00:50:34,200 --> 00:50:37,800
-Hi.
-What are you doing?
