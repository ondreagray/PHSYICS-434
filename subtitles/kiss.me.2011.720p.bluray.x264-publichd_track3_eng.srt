00:01:41,678 --> 00:01:48,711
<i>Last boarding call for flight TF168</i>
<i>from Stockholm to Malmö.</i>

2
00:01:48,922 --> 00:01:52,533
But that's OK I guess.

3
00:01:52,752 --> 00:01:56,280
You make my mom very happy.

4
00:01:57,872 --> 00:02:00,075
-A little bit more.
-OK.

5
00:02:01,161 --> 00:02:04,073
-Hold the glass.
-Wait wait wait.

6
00:02:04,284 --> 00:02:07,030
Is that all I'm getting?

7
00:02:14,025 --> 00:02:17,719
And let's pour some...
Oh, damn it!

8
00:02:17,939 --> 00:02:21,550
OK, so it's like that today? Hey...

9
00:02:24,350 --> 00:02:27,132
Happy birthday.

10
00:02:28,221 --> 00:02:30,341
-Oskar?
-Hold on.

11
00:02:30,553 --> 00:02:34,211
-Say something to the camera that describes Lasse.
-Damn.

12
00:02:34,425 --> 00:02:37,953
My sis and her boyfriend are running late.

13
00:02:40,961 --> 00:02:44,489
No, no, no. What are they doing?

14
00:02:44,707 --> 00:02:49,574
-I think your mom is a bit of a slut.
-Well I think your dad is a horn dog.

15
00:02:49,786 --> 00:02:52,782
-Look, it fits perfectly.
-I'll never take it off.

16
00:02:52,992 --> 00:02:55,146
You promise?

17
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:00,690
Of course I promise.

18
00:04:08,428 --> 00:04:11,837
Can you hold this?
I have to take the luggage.

19
00:04:29,035 --> 00:04:32,196
Let's go and grab a cigarette first.

20
00:04:35,072 --> 00:04:38,683
It's a bit crooked.

21
00:04:41,191 --> 00:04:43,808
Come on, you little muppet.

22
00:04:45,979 --> 00:04:48,015
<!-- (memorizing a speech) -->

23
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:55,005
Should I tell dad
or should you do it?

24
00:04:55,221 --> 00:05:00,040
No, of course you should tell him.
It's your dad.

25
00:05:09,958 --> 00:05:13,949
-I'm sorry. Could I borrow a lighter from you?
-Yes.

26
00:05:22,614 --> 00:05:25,563
It's not lit.

27
00:05:25,778 --> 00:05:28,560
Frida! damn, there you are. Hi.

28
00:05:31,981 --> 00:05:35,675
-Have you been here for a while, or?
-No, we just got here.

29
00:05:35,895 --> 00:05:38,179
Have you introduced yourselves?

30
00:05:38,393 --> 00:05:40,677
-This is Mia, my sister.
-Frida.

31
00:05:40,890 --> 00:05:44,667
And this is Tim, her boyfriend.
- Frida is Elisabeth's daughter.

32
00:05:44,887 --> 00:05:48,499
-Oh, OK.
-Well, let's not stand here all day.

33
00:05:49,591 --> 00:05:54,577
Thank you so much for that. But above all
I give my sincerest gratitude-

34
00:05:54,795 --> 00:06:00,822
-for this fantastic food that
Oskar and Frida have put together.

35
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:05,575
And... I get so nervous
when I speak like this.

36
00:06:05,786 --> 00:06:12,571
Men det känns också lite rörande
att ni är här när jag fyller 60-
But it feels quite touching
that you're all here when I'm turning 60-

37
00:06:12,780 --> 00:06:18,440
-and above all to celebrate that
Elisabeth and I are getting engaged.

38
00:06:19,691 --> 00:06:25,267
But above all, a great thank you
to Elisabeth for saying yes.

39
00:06:30,098 --> 00:06:34,171
-Well, look here. Come in. Hi.
-Hi, dad.

40
00:06:34,386 --> 00:06:40,911
Another surprise. This is my daughter Mia,
this is... - Hi, Tim. - This is Tim.

41
00:06:41,131 --> 00:06:43,250
This is great.

42
00:06:43,462 --> 00:06:48,908
Well, now I'm just completely
surrounded by love.

43
00:06:49,124 --> 00:06:52,487
And now I'm just going to sit down next to Elisabeth and relax.

44
00:06:52,704 --> 00:06:58,731
And let's have a fucking good time tonight, right?

45
00:07:05,443 --> 00:07:10,061
Hello.
I think the big gift just arrived.

46
00:07:10,272 --> 00:07:14,973
Well, now I'm getting emotional.

47
00:07:15,185 --> 00:07:21,259
Mia just told me that she and
Tim are going to get married.

48
00:07:27,133 --> 00:07:29,584
Congratulations!

49
00:07:33,336 --> 00:07:38,452
Hi, Mia. So good to see you.
Congratulations.

50
00:07:38,665 --> 00:07:41,198
Hi, Tim. Congratulations.
<!-- (clinking glasses) -->

51
00:07:44,368 --> 00:07:49,981
Excuse me for just interrupting like this,
but I would also like to say a few words.

52
00:07:50,197 --> 00:07:52,813
I'll start with you Lasse.

53
00:07:53,028 --> 00:07:57,349
We may not always agree about everything.

54
00:07:59,522 --> 00:08:04,851
That's OK too I guess. But above all
you make my mom very happy.

55
00:08:05,059 --> 00:08:10,095
And that's all I care about.
- And mom, you really deserve the best.

56
00:08:11,137 --> 00:08:16,370
And we have in some strange way
blended together as a family very quickly.

57
00:08:16,591 --> 00:08:19,503
And I am incredibly happy about that.

58
00:08:19,713 --> 00:08:22,200
Where are you, Oskar?

59
00:08:24,917 --> 00:08:27,996
And I hope things continue like that.

60
00:08:28,206 --> 00:08:33,700
And above all that you stay as happy as you seem now.

61
00:08:33,909 --> 00:08:38,444
So I would also like to propose a toast - to mom and Lasse.

62
00:08:44,317 --> 00:08:46,436
Cheers!

63
00:08:47,523 --> 00:08:52,011
-Hip, hip!
-Hooray! Hooray! Hooray! Hooray!

64
00:08:52,227 --> 00:08:56,964
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

65
00:08:57,181 --> 00:09:01,385
<i>Happy birthday dear Lasse</i>

66
00:09:02,968 --> 00:09:05,880
Elisabeth seems lovely.

67
00:09:07,756 --> 00:09:10,668
Elisabeth is amazing.

68
00:09:12,710 --> 00:09:17,943
-I know you're going to like her.
-You seem like you're well, Dad.

69
00:09:20,578 --> 00:09:23,242
I'm great.

70
00:09:26,739 --> 00:09:31,772
Can't we go for a walk tomorrow morning,
like we used to?

71
00:09:31,985 --> 00:09:34,850
When I was little, you mean?

72
00:10:08,287 --> 00:10:12,194
-What are you doing? Are you flirting with her?
-What?

73
00:10:13,283 --> 00:10:18,150
-With who?
-With Frida of course. You seem to enjoy each other's company anyway.

74
00:10:18,362 --> 00:10:21,559
Well, I didn't get any on the plane.

75
00:11:25,180 --> 00:11:29,087
-Good morning. Is it free?
-Sure, just go in.

76
00:11:30,176 --> 00:11:34,166
-Dad?
-Hey, I think they're still asleep.

77
00:11:54,863 --> 00:11:59,812
Hi. Should we go for a walk then?
- Hi Tim. Thank you for yesterday.

78
00:12:00,025 --> 00:12:03,435
I thought we were getting together this morning.

79
00:12:04,521 --> 00:12:08,725
-Are you sulking now?
-No, I'm not sulking.

80
00:12:08,934 --> 00:12:13,304
I think you're sulking.
- Tim, she's sulking, right?

81
00:12:13,514 --> 00:12:19,209
She is definitely sulking. Mia sulks
when Mia doesn't get what Mia wants.

82
00:12:19,425 --> 00:12:25,002
I was going to ask you to come along to Fyn tomorrow
and give us advice on a house extension.

83
00:12:25,212 --> 00:12:28,870
-But I realize it's the wrong time.
-No, I would love to do it.

84
00:12:29,084 --> 00:12:32,363
As long as I get some time alone with you.
We have barely seen each other yet.

85
00:12:32,581 --> 00:12:35,245
Of course.

86
00:12:36,328 --> 00:12:38,695
-Bye.
-Bye.

87
00:12:43,530 --> 00:12:46,857
Guys, how about a toast?

88
00:12:48,151 --> 00:12:51,182
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

89
00:13:00,057 --> 00:13:04,545
-Tim, how's the company doing?
-It's doing pretty well actually.

90
00:13:05,553 --> 00:13:09,590
It's always tough the first few years,
but I think-

91
00:13:09,799 --> 00:13:14,582
-with time it will go really well.

92
00:13:15,627 --> 00:13:18,825
We just received a huge project.

93
00:13:20,498 --> 00:13:23,115
Great, congratulations.

94
00:13:23,329 --> 00:13:25,994
And when will I become a grandfather?

95
00:13:26,202 --> 00:13:29,481
-Stop nagging, Dad.
-Yes, we're in no rush.

96
00:13:29,699 --> 00:13:34,269
Well, don't wait too long. I don't want
to be in a home when he or she comes along.

97
00:13:34,486 --> 00:13:37,849
Lasse! Time to take it down a notch, don't you think?

98
00:13:39,107 --> 00:13:44,223
Thank you Elisabeth. Why should all the pressure be on me?
Frida might beat me to it.

99
00:13:44,436 --> 00:13:46,472
Right?

100
00:13:49,973 --> 00:13:52,128
Yes, absolutely!

101
00:13:53,220 --> 00:13:56,879
-Where are you going for your honeymoon then, Mia?
-I don't know.

102
00:13:57,092 --> 00:14:02,835
I haven't even found a dress yet.
So I haven't had time to think about it yet.

103
00:14:03,045 --> 00:14:08,740
I was actually thinking about wearing mom's dress.
If you don't mind.

104
00:14:08,957 --> 00:14:12,236
Not at all, darling.

105
00:14:12,454 --> 00:14:15,284
Why would I?

106
00:14:22,987 --> 00:14:27,936
-Mia is nothing like I thought.
-No?

107
00:14:28,149 --> 00:14:32,186
Did you think she would be more like Oskar?

108
00:14:32,395 --> 00:14:34,928
Maybe.

109
00:14:35,143 --> 00:14:40,341
-Mia is more like her mother.
-Is everything OK between the two of you?

110
00:14:43,552 --> 00:14:46,169
Why do you ask?

111
00:14:47,216 --> 00:14:50,247
Doesn't it seem to be?

112
00:14:54,834 --> 00:15:00,447
Dad really didn't like that thing
about the dress. Did you notice?

113
00:15:02,911 --> 00:15:06,190
Maybe you should listen to him.

114
00:15:13,568 --> 00:15:17,973
Stop filming.
I'm not up for it.

115
00:15:21,770 --> 00:15:25,760
-Did you cheat?
-God, you're so curious.

116
00:15:25,975 --> 00:15:30,675
-Did you?
-No, I've never cheated and I never will.

117
00:15:30,887 --> 00:15:35,540
-I can't think of anything worse.
-Same here.

118
00:15:35,758 --> 00:15:40,955
Especially considering how Dad's been at it.
It's like sis says. We inherited Mom's faithful genes.

119
00:15:41,170 --> 00:15:45,030
-That's good.
-It feels different now that he's met Elisabeth.

120
00:15:45,250 --> 00:15:49,240
-Does it?
-Sure, he's so calm.

121
00:15:51,911 --> 00:15:57,108
And by the way,
you might have kids before Mia and Tim.

122
00:15:57,323 --> 00:15:59,691
God, you're so sweet.

123
00:15:59,904 --> 00:16:06,180
Mia is lucky to have you.
You're like, the best baby brother ever.

124
00:16:06,398 --> 00:16:08,967
I'm just trying to do my job.

125
00:16:11,561 --> 00:16:18,050
What do you mean, I should listen to him?
Don't you like the dress?

126
00:16:18,263 --> 00:16:24,088
Honestly.
It's an ugly 70's dress.

127
00:16:26,048 --> 00:16:32,371
What does it matter? What is
so important to you about that dress?

128
00:16:34,624 --> 00:16:39,077
I don't know. I've always
liked it since I was little.

129
00:16:39,287 --> 00:16:43,987
I've always told mom
I'm going to wear it when I get married.

130
00:16:49,278 --> 00:16:53,139
I just want our wedding
to be as perfect as possible.

131
00:16:53,358 --> 00:16:58,722
I just want us to be happy.
I don't want some dress or your dad to ruin that.

132
00:17:02,226 --> 00:17:04,261
OK?

133
00:17:30,368 --> 00:17:32,404
<!-- (Tim is laughing) -->

134
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:42,446
-I thinks she's awesome.
-I noticed. Maybe you should go instead of me.

135
00:17:42,658 --> 00:17:45,444
I don't have the time. I have to work.

136
00:17:45,660 --> 00:17:50,616
-Can't we buy one of those too?
-Absolutely.

137
00:17:53,789 --> 00:17:58,117
OK. I'll call you
when I get there. Bye.

138
00:18:13,133 --> 00:18:18,088
Oh good, it's Aston's, he's one of my students.
You can just toss it in the back.

139
00:18:27,557 --> 00:18:31,174
I know it's none of my business,
but I have to ask.

140
00:18:31,392 --> 00:18:33,847
Sure, just ask.

141
00:18:36,854 --> 00:18:41,099
Oskar and you...
Are you together or something?

142
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:47,388
-What?
-I don't know, I just think it's a bit...

143
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:54,814
What business is it of yours? Is it the age difference?
I'm a few years older than him, is that it?

144
00:18:55,030 --> 00:18:59,440
Excuse me. What business is it of mine?
We'll soon be in the same family.

145
00:18:59,657 --> 00:19:02,657
Don't you think that's a bit...

146
00:19:02,867 --> 00:19:08,108
No but, come on, we don't even have the same parents.
You make it sound like total inbreeding.

147
00:19:15,374 --> 00:19:20,911
But I have to say - your
little brother is insanely good in bed.

148
00:19:23,253 --> 00:19:27,877
-Oh my God, I don't want to hear that!
-What? But he is.

149
00:19:50,101 --> 00:19:54,725
-You were joking about you and Oskar of course?
-Well, yes.

150
00:19:56,354 --> 00:20:01,144
I couldn't resist teasing you.
You seem so anal.

151
00:20:03,232 --> 00:20:06,481
Oh God, I'm sorry, I didn't mean...

152
00:20:06,693 --> 00:20:11,897
-I didn't mean anal that way. Not "anal" anal.
-It's OK.

153
00:20:20,950 --> 00:20:26,108
Oskar said it's been a while
since you've been home to visit.

154
00:20:26,328 --> 00:20:29,612
-Yes, since last Christmas.
-OK.

155
00:20:29,830 --> 00:20:36,825
Well, Lasse seems a bit, it feels like
he's a bit different when you're at home.

156
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:44,378
I'm sorry, it might be because I'm so anal, but
it's been a while since I felt this analysed by someone.

157
00:20:44,588 --> 00:20:50,623
No God, I didn't mean to analyse.
It was...It was an observation.

158
00:21:42,993 --> 00:21:47,653
You, well... I'm sorry for what happened on the ferry,
that I was so...

159
00:21:48,997 --> 00:21:51,782
-Charmless?
-Yes, exactly.

160
00:21:52,582 --> 00:21:56,791
<i>Mia? Would you come out here for a moment?</i>

161
00:21:57,876 --> 00:21:59,868
Raspberry?

162
00:22:07,340 --> 00:22:11,086
I was thinking about having an extension here.

163
00:22:11,300 --> 00:22:17,051
Maybe a guesthouse
with a glass porch maybe?

164
00:22:17,261 --> 00:22:20,676
-What do you think?
-Yes, that would probably be pretty nice.

165
00:22:20,888 --> 00:22:25,595
You could build a cube there...

166
00:22:25,808 --> 00:22:28,843
...with a glass porch with a view of the forest, for example.

167
00:22:29,059 --> 00:22:31,679
Where is dad anyway?

168
00:22:33,478 --> 00:22:37,261
He had an emergency meeting in town.

169
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:42,057
-So he's not coming?
-No. He didn't tell you?

170
00:22:43,859 --> 00:22:47,226
-No.
-Well, it turned out a little weird.

171
00:22:50,070 --> 00:22:55,145
I’ll go inside and start making dinner,
and you and Frida can unpack. We’ll eat soon.

172
00:23:09,247 --> 00:23:14,286
<i>Hi, this is Lasse Sundström.</i>
<i>Leave a message and I'll call you back. Thanks, bye.</i>

173
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:20,998
Damn it, Dad. You can't just not show up
and leave me alone on a deserted island in the middle of nowhere.

174
00:23:21,962 --> 00:23:25,626
Damn it, I don't know these people.

175
00:23:26,798 --> 00:23:29,466
Thank you so bloody much!

176
00:23:42,515 --> 00:23:44,802
Well. Where is Mia then?

177
00:23:45,016 --> 00:23:47,850
I don't know. I can go look.

178
00:23:48,059 --> 00:23:52,185
Bring a flashlight. Maybe she got lost.
She's from the city.

179
00:23:52,395 --> 00:23:55,347
She was going to make a phone call.

180
00:23:55,563 --> 00:23:59,808
-I know she can be difficult to get to know.
-You don't say?

181
00:24:00,024 --> 00:24:02,692
Well, you'll be nice to her won't you?

182
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:07,726
I know! Here. Bring some wine and cigarettes.
Here you go.

183
00:24:07,945 --> 00:24:12,521
-What do you mean, nice? I'm always nice.
-Now go.

184
00:24:23,536 --> 00:24:26,109
So this is where you're hiding?

185
00:24:26,329 --> 00:24:29,282
-Do you want some wine?
-Please.

186
00:24:37,752 --> 00:24:40,586
Have you ever been married?

187
00:24:42,796 --> 00:24:44,788
No.

188
00:24:45,006 --> 00:24:49,132
The closest I ever came
was an engagement that lasted-

189
00:24:49,342 --> 00:24:54,500
-for exactly 5 months,
three weeks and two days.

190
00:24:54,719 --> 00:24:57,174
What happened?

191
00:24:58,930 --> 00:25:03,506
I discovered I was engaged
to someone I didn't know.

192
00:25:03,724 --> 00:25:09,308
-I thought I did, but I didn't.
-Did he stop turning your world upside down?

193
00:25:09,519 --> 00:25:12,851
No, I don't know if I've ever
met anyone like that.

194
00:25:13,062 --> 00:25:16,264
I'm not sure I would want
someone to do that to me.

195
00:25:22,818 --> 00:25:24,276
Thank you.

196
00:25:47,205 --> 00:25:52,198
I can't believe you seriously thought
I was together with Oskar.

197
00:25:53,667 --> 00:25:59,003
-Why? I don't know you.
-No, but you're funny. I like that.

198
00:26:08,842 --> 00:26:11,628
Come on, I'll show you something.

199
00:26:18,180 --> 00:26:21,298
I think they should be somewhere around here.

200
00:26:26,143 --> 00:26:28,181
Look.

201
00:29:55,336 --> 00:29:58,704
There's more coffee, if you want.

202
00:30:02,882 --> 00:30:05,550
-Hey.
-No thank you.

203
00:30:19,807 --> 00:30:23,755
Yes, I was wondering if you have car rental..

204
00:30:25,977 --> 00:30:28,218
OK.

205
00:30:28,437 --> 00:30:33,144
So there is no other way
of getting off the island?

206
00:30:34,232 --> 00:30:37,231
Yes, OK. Thanks a lot. Bye.

207
00:30:37,442 --> 00:30:41,852
-Damn!
-Mia! Do you want to come fishing?

208
00:31:28,510 --> 00:31:31,296
Why did you kiss me?

209
00:31:37,432 --> 00:31:41,214
We can't pretend
that it didn't happen.

210
00:31:57,067 --> 00:32:00,730
So. Ready to leave?

211
00:32:35,129 --> 00:32:39,456
We're going swimming.
We'll be back later.

212
00:33:04,269 --> 00:33:09,059
-So, you like...?
-Girls. Yes.

213
00:33:10,356 --> 00:33:12,810
You didn't know?

214
00:33:15,692 --> 00:33:18,810
Why did you kiss me?

215
00:33:19,027 --> 00:33:21,647
I don't know.

216
00:33:22,821 --> 00:33:25,654
I...I just did.

217
00:33:27,281 --> 00:33:32,439
-Is this stressing you out?
-I love Tim.

218
00:33:32,659 --> 00:33:37,864
I get that, but a person can be attracted to several people.

219
00:33:38,079 --> 00:33:41,197
Attracted to?

220
00:33:41,414 --> 00:33:44,164
You, I'm not like you.

221
00:33:45,249 --> 00:33:47,288
OK.

222
00:33:50,043 --> 00:33:55,627
-Are you sure?
-Of course I'm sure.

223
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:25,643
-Did something happen?
-No.

224
00:34:31,315 --> 00:34:34,184
No, I'm just tired.

225
00:40:40,926 --> 00:40:42,965
<!-- (thud) -->

226
00:40:53,683 --> 00:40:56,054
<!-- (knock) -->

227
00:40:57,102 --> 00:41:00,054
Hi! Good morning. Sleep well?

228
00:41:01,979 --> 00:41:04,979
Let's leave then.

229
00:41:32,037 --> 00:41:34,075
<!-- (the engine won't start) -->

230
00:41:34,288 --> 00:41:36,956
So. Let's see here then...

231
00:41:44,835 --> 00:41:48,249
-What is this, Frida?
-Take it easy, mom.

232
00:41:48,462 --> 00:41:52,956
It's a sensitive engine.
It takes a while for it to start up.

233
00:41:55,424 --> 00:41:58,377
<!-- (Mia sneezes) -->
Oh. Bless you.

234
00:42:00,593 --> 00:42:03,877
Frida how many times have I told you
to ask someone to look at this car?

235
00:42:04,095 --> 00:42:08,091
I know that Mom.
But you telling me doesn't help.

236
00:42:08,306 --> 00:42:11,673
It won't start because you're telling me.

237
00:42:16,102 --> 00:42:20,643
We'll have to take the bus.
We'll miss the ferry if we don't.

238
00:42:20,854 --> 00:42:25,893
We can make this bus if we go now.
It's just as well, we'll just walk.

239
00:42:43,491 --> 00:42:48,827
56 people already RSPV'd to the e-mail about the wedding.

240
00:43:12,882 --> 00:43:15,550
Have you got everything?

241
00:43:17,175 --> 00:43:20,377
-Did something happen, or what?
-No.

242
00:43:47,775 --> 00:43:50,016
Are you angry with me?

243
00:43:53,069 --> 00:43:58,772
I like you so much, Frida.
But it's a mess right now, you understand?

244
00:43:59,531 --> 00:44:02,780
I get that.

245
00:44:03,992 --> 00:44:08,035
But I'm right here.
You can talk to me.

246
00:44:09,536 --> 00:44:12,406
Frida, I love Tim.

247
00:44:16,999 --> 00:44:19,667
I don't believe that.

248
00:44:20,834 --> 00:44:24,332
We have a whole life together.

249
00:44:24,544 --> 00:44:27,627
I know you feel something for me.

250
00:44:29,755 --> 00:44:34,795
I'm going to marry Tim in a few months.
I can't feel this way about you, don't you get that?

251
00:44:36,092 --> 00:44:38,546
It's impossible.

252
00:44:59,021 --> 00:45:02,768
Then I guess you'll have to stay with him.

253
00:45:24,159 --> 00:45:29,032
OK... I just wanted you to get to know each other.

254
00:45:29,245 --> 00:45:32,245
It may have been stupid.

255
00:45:32,455 --> 00:45:38,455
I'm here to see you, Dad.
I wanted to show you what I've been doing at work.

256
00:45:38,667 --> 00:45:42,876
-Talk to you about the wedding. Don't you see I need to do that?
-Sure, just talk.

257
00:45:43,086 --> 00:45:46,418
Can't you focus on that?
Pull it tighter.

258
00:45:46,629 --> 00:45:49,463
Come on, pull it.

259
00:45:51,590 --> 00:45:54,341
Come on! Harder!

260
00:46:00,178 --> 00:46:05,964
Are you still serious about wearing Mom's dress to the wedding?
The most important day of your life?

261
00:46:06,640 --> 00:46:11,714
-If it's meant as a gibe at me I don't think it's worth it.
-What are you talking about?

262
00:46:11,934 --> 00:46:17,057
I know you think it's my fault that Mom and I got divorced.
But we were both in it.

263
00:46:17,270 --> 00:46:22,310
Yes. But only one of you was fucking her best friend
and lying about it! Right?

264
00:46:22,523 --> 00:46:27,859
Why do you always have to take her side?
We had problems long before that.

265
00:46:28,068 --> 00:46:31,933
OK. What does that have to do with the dress?
Why do you think it's a gibe?

266
00:46:32,153 --> 00:46:38,485
-Listen. Me being unfaithful...
-I don't want to hear about your fucking infidelity, don't you get it?!

267
00:46:38,698 --> 00:46:41,864
-OK, I get it, I get it.
-Hasn't it done enough damage to this family already?

268
00:46:42,075 --> 00:46:45,857
I get it.
Should we put up the net now or what?

269
00:46:47,370 --> 00:46:51,745
-Are we playing or not?
-No!

270
00:46:51,955 --> 00:46:56,532
-I did this for your sake.
-Hey! Time to eat!

271
00:46:56,750 --> 00:46:58,788
Yes!

272
00:47:00,793 --> 00:47:03,663
Pull a bit harder now!

273
00:47:05,921 --> 00:47:11,340
I think it was damn selfish of you to just not show up out at the cottage.

274
00:47:11,549 --> 00:47:15,047
-This damn nagging.
-Nagging?

275
00:47:16,427 --> 00:47:20,885
But you get along so well with Frida...

276
00:47:31,101 --> 00:47:35,049
Can I have the salad? Thank you.

277
00:47:36,479 --> 00:47:40,889
-Anyone want some bread?
-Thank you, I'm good.

278
00:47:43,191 --> 00:47:49,522
-Mia, did you tell them we're looking for a house?
-That's nice. What a great investment.

279
00:47:50,445 --> 00:47:54,227
Well, we've been looking for something small.

280
00:47:54,447 --> 00:47:58,692
Maybe to expand later.

281
00:47:58,949 --> 00:48:03,408
-Well, we've been looking for something small
-Eh, no...

282
00:48:03,618 --> 00:48:09,202
We looked at a few places,
but there hasn't been anything that interesting.

283
00:48:10,413 --> 00:48:13,081
I can't, I...

284
00:48:13,290 --> 00:48:16,040
I can't...

285
00:48:19,918 --> 00:48:26,168
...stay here. I had a kebab
earlier and I don't feel well.

286
00:48:26,380 --> 00:48:31,917
-I'll take the car I think. Home.
-Kebab? When did you start eating meat?

287
00:48:34,009 --> 00:48:37,258
No, it was one of these...

288
00:48:37,469 --> 00:48:41,928
It was...a vegetarian kebab.

289
00:48:43,014 --> 00:48:46,049
-A vebab.
-A vebab?

290
00:48:48,392 --> 00:48:53,466
-Exactly.
-What's that? Isn't meat the point of kebab?

291
00:48:55,020 --> 00:48:58,850
-Or tofu.
-That doesn't sound good at all.

292
00:48:59,981 --> 00:49:04,807
But Frida, you've had lots of wine.
We'll call you a taxi.

293
00:49:05,526 --> 00:49:08,442
-I can drive you.
-It's OK...

294
00:49:08,652 --> 00:49:13,989
Why would you stuff yourself with vebab when you're not craving meat?
It's stuff like that I don't get.

295
00:49:14,197 --> 00:49:20,315
No, well... You don't always get everything Lasse.

296
00:50:14,312 --> 00:50:16,348
Hello?

297
00:50:17,352 --> 00:50:19,388
Hi!

298
00:50:22,307 --> 00:50:27,423
God, I missed you.
I made dinner. Come on.

299
00:50:30,884 --> 00:50:36,877
What is it? Did I misunderstand
about the dress?

300
00:50:37,088 --> 00:50:39,124
What?

301
00:50:40,961 --> 00:50:45,994
Did something happen?
Is everything OK between you and Tim?

302
00:50:47,082 --> 00:50:49,947
Did you have a fight?

303
00:50:51,870 --> 00:50:57,235
Mom and I also fought a lot
when we were about to get married.

304
00:51:01,863 --> 00:51:05,641
It's nerves.

305
00:51:05,861 --> 00:51:10,147
It's nothing, Dad.
It's just...

306
00:51:13,231 --> 00:51:17,008
Can't you tell me what's going on?

307
00:51:17,228 --> 00:51:20,224
I'm just a bit tired.

308
00:51:24,057 --> 00:51:26,342
Hey, tomorrow...

309
00:51:27,429 --> 00:51:31,006
...why don't you show me your drafts.

310
00:51:31,219 --> 00:51:34,961
And we can spend all day together.

311
00:51:37,464 --> 00:51:39,916
Would you like that?

312
00:52:28,846 --> 00:52:32,589
-Hi.
-What are you doing?

313
00:52:32,802 --> 00:52:36,414
-I'm going home with you.
-Home?

314
00:52:37,507 --> 00:52:42,789
-I thought you were staying for a week?
-Yes, but I changed my mind.

315
00:52:43,004 --> 00:52:47,042
Coming back home really isn't your thing, is it.

316
00:53:15,898 --> 00:53:21,346
Aren't you bringing her flower inside?
She gave you such a lovely vase.

317
00:53:22,935 --> 00:53:26,096
It's not a flower.
It's an orchid.

318
00:53:27,432 --> 00:53:31,672
And it's been standing here
for 30 years, Elisabeth.

319
00:53:35,135 --> 00:53:38,415
You know, if you spent half as much time
caring about your family as you do your orchids-

320
00:53:38,633 --> 00:53:42,043
-things would probably be different.

321
00:53:55,705 --> 00:54:00,654
-Maybe you should say goodbye to Oskar?
-Ssh! I just want to go home.

322
00:54:19,314 --> 00:54:22,475
God, it feels so good to be home!

323
00:54:22,687 --> 00:54:27,009
If I ever want to go back,
remind me of this trip.

324
00:54:39,175 --> 00:54:41,709
What happened there?

325
00:54:43,256 --> 00:54:47,910
I ran into a branch on the island.
City kid, you know.

326
00:54:56,164 --> 00:55:01,943
-I need to go to the office for a bit now.
-No, don't bother. Take care of it tomorrow.

327
00:55:13,361 --> 00:55:15,646
What is it?

328
00:55:25,436 --> 00:55:27,887
I love you.

329
00:55:31,890 --> 00:55:34,886
I love you, Tim.

330
00:55:35,471 --> 00:55:40,966
Plastic headboards. We'd need to do something
about these floors, I think.

331
00:55:44,923 --> 00:55:48,416
A fireplace.

332
00:55:48,629 --> 00:55:54,622
-I've always wanted one.
-It would be nice in winter.

333
00:55:57,123 --> 00:56:00,616
-But Jakobsberg?
-What's wrong with Jakobsberg?

334
00:56:00,829 --> 00:56:05,282
It's so dull out there.
We would have to redo the whole floor.

335
00:56:05,492 --> 00:56:08,938
And when you get pregnant,
we won't even have room for a nursery.

336
00:56:09,157 --> 00:56:12,022
"When I get pregnant". That could take ages.

337
00:56:12,238 --> 00:56:17,224
Not if you stop taking birth control.
It would take a year to a year and a half.

338
00:56:17,443 --> 00:56:22,180
-What do you mean, I don't want kids now. You know that.
-Maybe not <i>now</i> now.

339
00:56:22,398 --> 00:56:25,310
But in the near future.

340
00:56:26,811 --> 00:56:31,133
You do want kids with me?
We are getting married, right?

341
00:56:31,350 --> 00:56:36,549
-If we're having kids, then that requires planning!
-Tim you can't plan everything. It doesn't work that way.

342
00:56:36,763 --> 00:56:41,334
Well then, how do things work?
Explain to me how things work!

343
00:56:46,465 --> 00:56:50,159
Hey, I'm sorry about yesterday.

344
00:56:50,379 --> 00:56:52,866
You're right.

345
00:56:53,085 --> 00:56:57,290
It makes me panic when you're deciding everything.
Can't you see how stressful it is?

346
00:56:57,499 --> 00:57:02,829
-Well, you need someone to keep you in line.
-What did you say?

347
00:57:03,037 --> 00:57:06,696
Check out Oskar.
He's coming here on Thursday.

348
00:57:06,909 --> 00:57:09,858
He's grown some kind of mustache.

349
00:57:10,074 --> 00:57:12,193
He looks insane. He looks like a psychopath, doesn't he?

350
00:57:12,406 --> 00:57:14,644
<!-- (phone ringing) --->

351
00:57:22,066 --> 00:57:24,731
This is Tim.

352
00:58:05,745 --> 00:58:08,030
Frida?

353
00:58:08,243 --> 00:58:13,573
It's very empty and lonely here.
Can't you come over here?

354
00:58:13,781 --> 00:58:16,896
I'm coming. I'm coming.

355
00:58:34,725 --> 00:58:36,963
No...

356
00:58:38,389 --> 00:58:42,427
-What?
-Well... I don't know.

357
00:58:51,422 --> 00:58:57,664
It's like you've been on another planet these past two weeks.
I barely recognize you.

358
00:58:59,542 --> 00:59:01,993
What is it?

359
00:59:27,273 --> 00:59:30,601
I will leave you alone.

360
01:00:25,234 --> 01:00:30,386
-You want come over for dinner with us tonight?
-Eh, I can't.

361
01:00:30,606 --> 01:00:34,727
How come you never come over for dinner anymore?

362
01:00:34,936 --> 01:00:37,849
-Did something happen?
-No.

363
01:00:40,890 --> 01:00:45,344
-But, Frida, what's going on?
-Well, I don't know how to say this.

364
01:00:47,636 --> 01:00:52,373
-Me and Mia, we...
-Mia?

365
01:00:52,591 --> 01:00:56,168
Something happened
between her and me.

366
01:00:59,003 --> 01:01:01,620
Something?

367
01:01:01,835 --> 01:01:05,328
Please try to explain, would you.

368
01:01:13,244 --> 01:01:20,278
I think Mia is bisexual,
but I don't think she wants to see it that way.

369
01:01:22,487 --> 01:01:25,270
And what the hell is that supposed to mean?

370
01:01:27,900 --> 01:01:30,813
That I'm in love with her.

371
01:01:32,564 --> 01:01:34,683
Oh dear lord!

372
01:01:35,645 --> 01:01:39,719
I asked you to be nice to her,
not fall in love with her!

373
01:01:39,934 --> 01:01:45,548
-Well then I misunderstood you completely because falling in love with her was my plan all along.
-How the hell can you be joking about something like this?

374
01:01:46,763 --> 01:01:51,713
You can love whoever you want,
but not Lasse's daughter, do you get it?

375
01:01:51,926 --> 01:01:56,663
-Anyone, but not her!
-What am I supposed to do? I'm not exactly proud of myself right now.

376
01:02:00,420 --> 01:02:05,998
-And Elin?
-She doesn't know, but she gets it.

377
01:02:06,208 --> 01:02:10,613
After you've been put through the exact same thing yourself.

378
01:02:10,830 --> 01:02:16,242
Maybe you remember how devastated you were?
And now you're putting Elin through the exact same thing.

379
01:02:19,407 --> 01:02:22,487
Damn that's low, Frida.

380
01:02:25,570 --> 01:02:28,436
-What were you thinking?
-I haven't been thinking.

381
01:02:28,651 --> 01:02:31,316
No, you haven't been.

382
01:02:33,565 --> 01:02:35,850
No...

383
01:02:37,728 --> 01:02:43,757
<i>No, I've never cheated and I never will.</i>
<i>I can't think of anything worse.</i>

384
01:02:43,974 --> 01:02:45,964
<!-- (a door is opened and closed) -->

385
01:02:46,181 --> 01:02:50,421
Are you at home?
I waited for you for over an hour.

386
01:02:50,636 --> 01:02:53,716
I'm sorry, I got late.

387
01:02:58,215 --> 01:03:00,702
I missed you.

388
01:03:04,211 --> 01:03:06,579
What is it?

389
01:03:11,123 --> 01:03:14,321
-I can't.
-What?

390
01:03:19,825 --> 01:03:21,898
What...?

391
01:03:23,115 --> 01:03:26,395
I hate doing this to you so much.

392
01:03:37,147 --> 01:03:39,598
Who is it?

393
01:03:45,141 --> 01:03:48,552
It's Mia, Oskar's sister.

394
01:03:53,469 --> 01:03:59,663
It must be hard for Lasse having two dykes in the family.
Since he's had such a hard time with us.

395
01:04:02,921 --> 01:04:06,284
I'm in love with her.

396
01:04:36,648 --> 01:04:42,014
So you've been cheating on me with Mia,
who is getting married to her boyfriend.

397
01:04:47,391 --> 01:04:50,222
What the hell are you doing?

398
01:04:52,638 --> 01:04:59,246
Well, I really don't want to do this to you.
I know exactly what you're feeling right now.

399
01:04:59,466 --> 01:05:01,918
I understand.

400
01:05:06,587 --> 01:05:10,708
You know what the most disgusting part is?

401
01:05:10,917 --> 01:05:15,122
I really thought you were better than this.

402
01:05:17,080 --> 01:05:20,277
You're just an experiment to her.

403
01:05:21,951 --> 01:05:25,694
She's never going to leave him.
Do you get that?

404
01:06:07,920 --> 01:06:14,576
Yes. It's... Someone was hung over
when they treaded this.

405
01:06:14,791 --> 01:06:17,324
Give me the glass!

406
01:06:19,246 --> 01:06:22,491
Now tell me about the mustache.
It's some kind of age crisis?

407
01:06:22,702 --> 01:06:27,155
I don't know, it just happened.
Tim was totally freaked out.

408
01:06:28,115 --> 01:06:32,983
He said I had to shave it off
if I wanted to be his best man.

409
01:06:33,195 --> 01:06:38,311
Can I kidnap him this weekend?
Drag him to the archipelago. A bachelor's party or something.

410
01:06:38,525 --> 01:06:41,190
Sure, do that.

411
01:06:42,231 --> 01:06:45,143
-Have you heard from dad by the way?
-Yes, everything's fine.

412
01:06:45,354 --> 01:06:48,764
-You haven't heard from him?
-No.

413
01:06:48,976 --> 01:06:51,179
OK.

414
01:06:54,805 --> 01:07:00,217
I'm meant to say hi from Frida by the way.
She's here this weekend with her school.

415
01:07:00,427 --> 01:07:03,790
She's doing a concert at Östra Real.

416
01:07:04,757 --> 01:07:07,623
You can hang out then. It's cool.

417
01:07:15,292 --> 01:07:20,159
-I talked to Frida.
-Hm. She's all good?

418
01:07:23,370 --> 01:07:26,449
-Not really actually.
-Oh.

419
01:07:32,988 --> 01:07:37,808
-She is in love with your daughter.
-What did you say?

420
01:07:39,900 --> 01:07:45,182
-Come again?
-From what I gather, Mia has feelings for Frida too.

421
01:07:46,229 --> 01:07:50,599
-But Mia is engaged to Tim.
-Of course I know that, but...

422
01:07:51,684 --> 01:07:55,924
-So maybe she's bisexual.
-No, I don't think so.

423
01:07:56,139 --> 01:08:00,758
-Let's eat now. Sit down.
-Are you kidding?

424
01:08:02,468 --> 01:08:04,920
Haricot verts?

425
01:08:14,710 --> 01:08:20,785
So it's OK that my daughter is gay,
but not Mia?

426
01:08:20,997 --> 01:08:24,989
My daughter is not homosexual,
Elisabeth.

427
01:08:27,451 --> 01:08:33,196
-Maybe you think it's wrong, maybe you think it's a bit disgusting?
-Did I say that?

428
01:08:33,406 --> 01:08:38,025
-But it's not completely normal, right?
-No, it's not completely fucking normal, is it?

429
01:08:38,236 --> 01:08:43,056
No parents really want their child to be gay or lesbian,
if we're being honest, Elisabeth.

430
01:08:43,274 --> 01:08:45,974
So Frida isn't normal?

431
01:08:49,520 --> 01:08:52,681
Lasse when Frida came out...

432
01:08:53,767 --> 01:08:56,798
...it wasn't easy, I admit.

433
01:08:57,015 --> 01:09:02,427
But today I'm very happy that she is who she is.

434
01:09:02,636 --> 01:09:08,131
That she stands up for who she is.
She wouldn't be my daughter otherwise.

435
01:09:08,341 --> 01:09:11,953
Let's not talk about this anymore. OK?

436
01:09:13,212 --> 01:09:16,706
How would that solve anything?

437
01:09:20,874 --> 01:09:22,946
Lasse?

438
01:09:26,329 --> 01:09:29,609
This is completely insane!

439
01:09:33,740 --> 01:09:36,819
Who the hell are you, really?

440
01:09:39,237 --> 01:09:42,149
What the hell are you thinking right now?

441
01:09:48,564 --> 01:09:50,802
No, God damn it!

442
01:12:45,278 --> 01:12:47,317
Mia?

443
01:12:55,993 --> 01:13:00,203
I shouldn't have come. I have to...I have to go.
Oskar couldn't make it, but he says hi.

444
01:13:00,412 --> 01:13:03,033
Wait, wait, wait, wait...

445
01:13:08,334 --> 01:13:14,251
Just give me five minutes, I'll send
the kids home with their parents.

446
01:13:15,338 --> 01:13:17,709
Wait for me.

447
01:13:18,924 --> 01:13:21,378
Don't go.

448
01:13:25,427 --> 01:13:28,760
I'm so happy you're here.

449
01:13:46,190 --> 01:13:48,763
Did you hide here, or what?

450
01:13:52,110 --> 01:13:56,652
I want to go away with you.
Far away.

451
01:13:59,573 --> 01:14:01,898
Do you want to?

452
01:16:20,743 --> 01:16:24,027
I think you've been lying a little bit to me.

453
01:16:29,623 --> 01:16:32,457
I'm hardly your first girl.

454
01:16:35,377 --> 01:16:38,412
No. Can you tell?

455
01:16:38,629 --> 01:16:41,379
Yes, you could say that.

456
01:16:44,632 --> 01:16:50,336
I thought about it on Fyn too.
Why haven't you told me?

457
01:16:50,552 --> 01:16:53,718
-Are you ashamed?
-No.

458
01:16:55,806 --> 01:17:00,347
I just didn't think I would feel like this again.

459
01:17:00,559 --> 01:17:03,428
Were you in love with her?

460
01:17:04,853 --> 01:17:10,225
-Will it make you jealous if I say yes?
-Eh, yes. Absolutely.

461
01:17:14,067 --> 01:17:16,853
-Does Tim know?
-No.

462
01:17:18,111 --> 01:17:20,779
It was much earlier.

463
01:17:22,113 --> 01:17:25,113
I've never cheated on him.

464
01:17:25,324 --> 01:17:27,362
Until now.

465
01:17:29,951 --> 01:17:34,161
I want to be with you all the time.

466
01:17:34,371 --> 01:17:38,414
I don't want to be just someone you cheat on Tim with.

467
01:18:04,181 --> 01:18:08,129
If I had the choice, I would build a house somewhere by the ocean.

468
01:18:09,517 --> 01:18:12,090
Andalusia.

469
01:18:12,311 --> 01:18:14,979
Or Catalonia.

470
01:18:16,772 --> 01:18:21,847
-I could live with you in a shoe box.
-Seriously?

471
01:18:22,067 --> 01:18:25,150
What if we did.

472
01:18:25,360 --> 01:18:30,400
Just take off, you and me.
And start over somewhere else.

473
01:18:34,741 --> 01:18:37,776
Why can't we start over here?

474
01:18:39,536 --> 01:18:42,903
Is that too realistic for you?

475
01:18:45,789 --> 01:18:48,114
Not romantic enough?

476
01:18:55,545 --> 01:18:57,584
But, Frida...

477
01:19:17,517 --> 01:19:19,556
Frida.

478
01:19:40,614 --> 01:19:45,737
I've never felt as strongly about anyone as I do about you in my entire life.

479
01:19:48,995 --> 01:19:51,829
But you just want to run away all the time.

480
01:19:56,749 --> 01:19:59,370
Start over?

481
01:20:02,211 --> 01:20:05,875
Do you know how much I'd want to do that.

482
01:20:11,008 --> 01:20:14,755
But you're getting married to Tim in three months.

483
01:20:16,470 --> 01:20:19,837
I am so stupid.

484
01:20:25,850 --> 01:20:28,684
What are you doing?

485
01:20:38,817 --> 01:20:41,354
Do you love him?

486
01:21:03,999 --> 01:21:06,915
You can't marry Tim.

487
01:21:08,668 --> 01:21:12,616
I won't be able to handle that.

488
01:22:11,165 --> 01:22:13,489
<!-- (phone ringing) -->

489
01:22:20,504 --> 01:22:25,045
-Dad, did something happen?
-No, I just wanted to hear your voice.

490
01:22:26,716 --> 01:22:31,589
And...say thank you for the vase I got.
I'm not sure I did.

491
01:22:31,802 --> 01:22:34,375
OK. You're welcome.

492
01:22:35,346 --> 01:22:38,262
<i>-Are you OK?</i>?
-Yes, I'm fine.

493
01:22:39,015 --> 01:22:43,390
I woke you up didn't I? I didn't realize
it was this late.

494
01:22:43,601 --> 01:22:48,060
-<i>Let's hang up.</i>
-OK.

495
01:22:48,812 --> 01:22:50,555
Fine.

496
01:22:51,397 --> 01:22:54,267
<i>-Bye then.</i>
-Bye.

497
01:23:42,595 --> 01:23:48,466
We could live like this, couldn't we?
This is almost like a shoe box.

498
01:23:59,147 --> 01:24:03,807
I wouldn't want to live like this.
It's not real.

499
01:24:04,025 --> 01:24:08,021
Shutting ourselves in a room miles away from everything.

500
01:24:13,447 --> 01:24:18,191
It's hard for me, Frida.
I'm not as brave as you.

501
01:24:21,286 --> 01:24:25,744
I just wish we didn't have to be questioned.

502
01:24:38,171 --> 01:24:41,834
I want them to ask.

503
01:24:42,048 --> 01:24:44,538
I'm proud of you.

504
01:24:46,092 --> 01:24:50,384
I want to show everyone how much I like you.

505
01:25:03,520 --> 01:25:05,677
<!-- (laughing) -->

506
01:25:11,483 --> 01:25:14,436
-One o'clock at Mosebacke, then.
-Yes.

507
01:25:18,070 --> 01:25:20,109
Hey.

508
01:25:28,451 --> 01:25:33,526
I don't get any stubble, just some stuff.
I thought it looked OK.

509
01:25:46,921 --> 01:25:48,829
<!-- (honk, honk) -->

510
01:26:14,813 --> 01:26:18,809
-I think I've known that about Mia the whole time.
-What?

511
01:26:20,733 --> 01:26:26,520
Yes, even though it only was suspicions
I had a hard time dealing with it.

512
01:26:28,738 --> 01:26:32,070
You know, when Frida told me...

513
01:26:33,533 --> 01:26:39,201
...I remember thinking, in a state of panic,
about everything I would miss out on.

514
01:26:39,411 --> 01:26:44,118
You know, wedding, becoming a grandmother,
all those things.

515
01:26:44,331 --> 01:26:48,078
But, hey...now I know better.

516
01:26:50,168 --> 01:26:52,207
Yes.

517
01:26:53,086 --> 01:26:56,999
I just want her to be fine.

518
01:28:34,023 --> 01:28:39,726
-I'm going to the city to take care of some things.
-Now? We're leaving soon.

519
01:28:42,111 --> 01:28:47,186
-What?
-To the church. You're the one who booked the meeting with the pastor at one.

520
01:29:17,174 --> 01:29:20,293
Well, well, you're nervous now, aren't you?

521
01:29:21,635 --> 01:29:28,798
Wedding ceremonies are actually over really quickly.
So I want you to really cherish the moment when you're up here with me.

522
01:29:29,015 --> 01:29:32,632
It goes like this:
first you say your vows to each other.

523
01:29:32,850 --> 01:29:35,934
then I turn to you Tim.
And your full name.

524
01:29:36,144 --> 01:29:41,385
-Tim Aaron Bratthall.
-Tim Aaron, nice name, Bratthall.

525
01:29:41,606 --> 01:29:45,020
-Do you take this...
-Maria.

526
01:29:45,233 --> 01:29:51,565
You'll have to raise your voice for the real thing, so aunt Beda in the back can hear you too.
One more time, a little louder.

527
01:29:51,779 --> 01:29:54,103
Maria Eva Sundström.

528
01:29:54,322 --> 01:29:58,567
...Maria Eva Sundström
as your lawfully wedded wife?

529
01:29:58,783 --> 01:30:01,403
-Yes.
-And then we reverse it so it's your turn.

530
01:30:01,618 --> 01:30:05,696
And then the mandatory kiss.
Badabing, badabong.

531
01:30:05,912 --> 01:30:10,987
and then the mandatory kiss.
Till death do you part. Done.

532
01:30:15,668 --> 01:30:18,158
I can't.

533
01:30:24,215 --> 01:30:26,670
I'm sorry.

534
01:30:29,385 --> 01:30:34,626
She's just nervous, for sure.
Go talk to her and then come back.

535
01:30:34,847 --> 01:30:38,843
-This happens all the time. All the time.
-Mia!

536
01:30:41,100 --> 01:30:42,926
Oh my, oh my God.

537
01:30:43,143 --> 01:30:45,135
Mia!

538
01:30:50,022 --> 01:30:52,061
Mia!

539
01:30:53,483 --> 01:30:55,522
Mia!

540
01:31:09,576 --> 01:31:13,323
Frida! Frida!

541
01:31:22,292 --> 01:31:26,419
-So lucky, I thought you had left.
-Mia, I can't do this.

542
01:31:26,628 --> 01:31:30,707
I just left Tim in the church.
I can't marry him. I'm in love with you.

543
01:31:30,922 --> 01:31:34,005
But you're not done with him.

544
01:31:34,216 --> 01:31:36,967
You're not done with your life together.

545
01:31:37,176 --> 01:31:43,793
What happened today, when I sat there waiting for you because you were with him.
It will be like that all the time, won't it?

546
01:31:45,640 --> 01:31:50,632
I needed to wake up from this dream
with you and today I did.

547
01:31:50,851 --> 01:31:56,685
-Don't you understand what I sacrificed for us?
-Jesus Christ, you're not the only one making sacrifices.

548
01:31:58,231 --> 01:32:01,314
This isn't just about you.

549
01:32:06,152 --> 01:32:09,235
-Frida, please, don't go.
-But you're not fighting for this.

550
01:32:09,446 --> 01:32:13,773
-Yes I am, I'm here now.
-No, you're not!

551
01:32:18,660 --> 01:32:21,576
Frida, don't go. Frida!

552
01:32:55,557 --> 01:32:59,849
It's the wedding menus.
They just came.

553
01:33:00,060 --> 01:33:02,976
Done. Some timing.

554
01:33:04,313 --> 01:33:08,688
-I've looked everywhere for you.
-I have nothing to say to you.

555
01:33:11,359 --> 01:33:17,477
But I am thinking about what
to say to our families and our friends.

556
01:33:19,572 --> 01:33:23,438
"Regrettably, the wedding is cancelled."

557
01:33:26,118 --> 01:33:28,987
"Mia is apparently a dyke."

558
01:33:30,829 --> 01:33:34,446
How do you...how do you know?

559
01:33:37,333 --> 01:33:39,953
I saw you and Frida.

560
01:33:44,045 --> 01:33:45,918
You fucking asshole.

561
01:33:50,716 --> 01:33:54,794
I'm sorry you found out about it like this.

562
01:33:55,010 --> 01:33:56,836
Get out of here, damn it.

563
01:33:59,388 --> 01:34:02,138
Get the hell out of here, damn it!

564
01:34:02,348 --> 01:34:05,881
-Tim...
-Leave, damn it! Leave!

565
01:34:52,920 --> 01:34:59,122
I think the biggest reason Tim and I were getting married
was that everyone was expecting us to.

566
01:35:05,470 --> 01:35:08,220
Are you ashamed of me?

567
01:35:09,472 --> 01:35:13,931
I just want you to be happy and healthy.

568
01:35:15,309 --> 01:35:20,550
I don't feel like I have a choice, dad.

569
01:35:24,356 --> 01:35:29,894
-Do you think it's my fault?
-Why does it have to be anyone's fault?

570
01:35:34,196 --> 01:35:37,030
Why Frida?

571
01:35:37,239 --> 01:35:40,155
Because I love her.

572
01:36:17,138 --> 01:36:19,177
Seven years, Mia.

573
01:36:23,309 --> 01:36:25,348
Seven years.

574
01:36:32,648 --> 01:36:37,308
I thought I knew who I was building a life with.

575
01:36:38,777 --> 01:36:41,445
I am so sorry, Tim.

576
01:36:43,279 --> 01:36:47,062
You don't exist to me anymore.

577
01:37:37,229 --> 01:37:40,063
I'm going to Skåne with dad.

578
01:37:41,148 --> 01:37:44,101
I'll move out when I get back.

579
01:38:30,636 --> 01:38:33,257
-Hi.
-Is Frida here?

580
01:38:33,472 --> 01:38:37,515
-No, she's not here.
-Do you know where she is?

581
01:38:42,310 --> 01:38:44,432
Are you Mia?

582
01:38:44,645 --> 01:38:49,270
-Can you tell me where she is?
-Not on your life.

583
01:39:11,661 --> 01:39:15,159
Where is Frida?
Elisabeth, do you know where she is?

584
01:39:15,372 --> 01:39:18,822
She needs peace and quiet, Mia.

585
01:39:19,041 --> 01:39:22,539
And you're not exactly what I'd call peace and quiet to her right now.

586
01:39:22,752 --> 01:39:28,373
I have made a complete fool of myself, don't you understand that?
I have nothing left.

587
01:39:29,964 --> 01:39:33,297
If you know where she is,
please tell me - now.

588
01:39:43,264 --> 01:39:46,714
I really hope you know what you're doing.

589
01:39:50,894 --> 01:39:55,684
Let me see.
Her flight to Barcelona leaves in 40 minutes.

590
01:40:10,489 --> 01:40:12,528
Now go.

591
01:41:25,618 --> 01:41:32,152
<i>Flight DY3656 to Barcelona</i>
<i>is departing from Gate 7.</i>
