1
00:00:38,021 --> 00:00:41,521
-I'm going home with you.
-Home?

2
00:00:42,567 --> 00:00:47,676
-I thought you were staying for a week?
-Yes, but I changed my mind.

3
00:00:47,877 --> 00:00:51,780
Coming back home really isn't your thing, is it.

4
00:01:19,659 --> 00:01:24,929
Aren't you bringing her flower inside?
She gave you such a lovely vase.

5
00:01:26,457 --> 00:01:29,515
It's not a flower.
It's an orchid.

6
00:01:30,802 --> 00:01:34,906
And it's been standing here
for 30 years, Elisabeth.

7
00:01:38,245 --> 00:01:41,423
You know, if you spent half as much time
caring about your family as you do your orchids-

8
00:01:41,624 --> 00:01:44,923
-things would probably be different.

9
00:01:58,118 --> 00:02:02,905
-Maybe you should say goodbye to Oskar?
-Ssh! I just want to go home.

10
00:02:20,928 --> 00:02:23,985
God, it feels so good to be home!

11
00:02:24,186 --> 00:02:28,370
If I ever want to go back,
remind me of this trip.

12
00:02:40,117 --> 00:02:42,571
What happened there?

13
00:02:44,060 --> 00:02:48,565
I ran into a branch on the island.
City kid, you know.

14
00:02:56,531 --> 00:03:02,123
-I need to go to the office for a bit now.
-No, don't bother. Take care of it tomorrow.

15
00:03:13,146 --> 00:03:15,358
What is it?

16
00:03:24,812 --> 00:03:27,186
I love you.

17
00:03:31,048 --> 00:03:33,944
I love you, Tim.

18
00:03:34,507 --> 00:03:39,818
Plastic headboards. We'd need to do something
about these floors, I think.

19
00:03:43,639 --> 00:03:47,019
A fireplace.

20
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:53,013
-I've always wanted one.
-It would be nice in winter.

21
00:03:55,427 --> 00:03:58,806
-But Jakobsberg?
-What's wrong with Jakobsberg?

22
00:03:59,007 --> 00:04:03,311
It's so dull out there.
We would have to redo the whole floor.

23
00:04:03,513 --> 00:04:06,852
And when you get pregnant,
we won't even have room for a nursery.

24
00:04:07,053 --> 00:04:09,829
"When I get pregnant". That could take ages.

25
00:04:10,030 --> 00:04:14,857
Not if you stop taking birth control.
It would take a year to a year and a half.

26
00:04:15,058 --> 00:04:19,645
-What do you mean, I don't want kids now. You know that.
-Maybe not now now.

27
00:04:19,846 --> 00:04:22,662
But in the near future.

28
00:04:24,110 --> 00:04:28,294
You do want kids with me?
We are getting married, right?

29
00:04:28,495 --> 00:04:33,524
-If we're having kids, then that requires planning!
-Tim you can't plan everything. It doesn't work that way.

30
00:04:33,725 --> 00:04:38,150
Well then, how do things work?
Explain to me how things work!

31
00:04:43,098 --> 00:04:46,679
Hey, I'm sorry about yesterday.

32
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:49,294
You're right.

33
00:04:49,535 --> 00:04:53,558
It makes me panic when you're deciding everything.
Can't you see how stressful it is?

34
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:58,908
-Well, you need someone to keep you in line.
-What did you say?

35
00:04:59,110 --> 00:05:02,650
Check out Oskar.
He's coming here on Thursday.

36
00:05:02,851 --> 00:05:05,707
He's grown some kind of mustache.

37
00:05:05,908 --> 00:05:07,960
He looks insane. He looks like a psychopath, doesn't he?

38
00:05:17,494 --> 00:05:20,069
This is Tim.

39
00:05:59,695 --> 00:06:01,907
Frida?

40
00:06:02,109 --> 00:06:07,258
It's very empty and lonely here.
Can't you come over here?

41
00:06:07,459 --> 00:06:10,476
I'm coming. I'm coming.

42
00:06:27,694 --> 00:06:29,867
No...

43
00:06:31,235 --> 00:06:35,137
-What?
-Well... I don't know.

44
00:06:43,826 --> 00:06:49,861
It's like you've been on another planet these past two weeks.
I barely recognize you.

45
00:06:51,671 --> 00:06:54,045
What is it?

46
00:07:18,464 --> 00:07:21,682
I will leave you alone.

47
00:08:14,463 --> 00:08:19,451
-You want come over for dinner with us tonight?
-Eh, I can't.

48
00:08:19,653 --> 00:08:23,635
How come you never come over for dinner anymore?

49
00:08:23,836 --> 00:08:26,653
-Did something happen?
-No.

50
00:08:29,589 --> 00:08:33,894
-But, Frida, what's going on?
-Well, I don't know how to say this.

51
00:08:36,106 --> 00:08:40,693
-Me and Mia, we...
-Mia?

52
00:08:40,894 --> 00:08:44,353
Something happened
between her and me.

53
00:08:47,089 --> 00:08:49,623
Something?

54
00:08:49,825 --> 00:08:53,204
Please try to explain, would you.

55
00:09:00,847 --> 00:09:07,646
I think Mia is bisexual,
but I don't think she wants to see it that way.

56
00:09:09,778 --> 00:09:12,474
And what the hell is that supposed to mean?

57
00:09:15,008 --> 00:09:17,824
That I'm in love with her.

58
00:09:19,514 --> 00:09:21,566
Oh dear lord!

59
00:09:22,491 --> 00:09:26,433
I asked you to be nice to her,
not fall in love with her!

60
00:09:26,634 --> 00:09:32,065
-Well then I misunderstood you completely because falling in love with her was my plan all along.
-How the hell can you be joking about something like this?

61
00:09:33,232 --> 00:09:38,019
You can love whoever you want,
but not Lasse's daughter, do you get it?

62
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:42,807
-Anyone, but not her!
-What am I supposed to do? I'm not exactly proud of myself right now.

63
00:09:46,427 --> 00:09:51,818
-And Elin?
-She doesn't know, but she gets it.

64
00:09:52,019 --> 00:09:56,283
After you've been put through the exact same thing yourself.

65
00:09:56,485 --> 00:10:01,714
Maybe you remember how devastated you were?
And now you're putting Elin through the exact same thing.

66
00:10:04,772 --> 00:10:07,749
Damn that's low, Frida.

67
00:10:10,726 --> 00:10:13,502
-What were you thinking?
-I haven't been thinking.

68
00:10:13,703 --> 00:10:16,277
No, you haven't been.

69
00:10:18,450 --> 00:10:20,662
No...

70
00:10:22,473 --> 00:10:28,306
No, I've never cheated and I never will.
I can't think of anything worse.

71
00:10:30,639 --> 00:10:34,743
Are you at home?
I waited for you for over an hour.

72
00:10:34,944 --> 00:10:37,921
I'm sorry, I got late.

73
00:10:42,266 --> 00:10:44,679
I missed you.

74
00:10:48,059 --> 00:10:50,352
What is it?

75
00:10:54,737 --> 00:10:57,834
-I can't.
-What?

76
00:11:03,145 --> 00:11:05,156
What...?

77
00:11:06,323 --> 00:11:09,501
I hate doing this to you so much.

78
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:22,253
Who is it?

79
00:11:27,604 --> 00:11:30,903
It's Mia, Oskar's sister.

80
00:11:35,650 --> 00:11:41,644
It must be hard for Lasse having two dykes in the family.
Since he's had such a hard time with us.

81
00:11:44,782 --> 00:11:48,040
I'm in love with her.

82
00:12:17,368 --> 00:12:22,557
So you've been cheating on me with Mia,
who is getting married to her boyfriend.

83
00:12:27,747 --> 00:12:30,482
What the hell are you doing?

84
00:12:32,816 --> 00:12:39,212
Well, I really don't want to do this to you.
I know exactly what you're feeling right now.

85
00:12:39,413 --> 00:12:41,787
I understand.

86
00:12:46,292 --> 00:12:50,275
You know what the most disgusting part is?

87
00:12:50,476 --> 00:12:54,539
I really thought you were better than this.

88
00:12:56,430 --> 00:12:59,528
You're just an experiment to her.

89
00:13:01,137 --> 00:13:04,758
She's never going to leave him.
Do you get that?

90
00:13:45,590 --> 00:13:51,987
Yes. It's... Someone was hung over
when they treaded this.

91
00:13:52,188 --> 00:13:54,642
Give me the glass!

92
00:13:56,493 --> 00:13:59,631
Now tell me about the mustache.
It's some kind of age crisis?

93
00:13:59,832 --> 00:14:04,136
I don't know, it just happened.
Tim was totally freaked out.

94
00:14:05,061 --> 00:14:09,768
He said I had to shave it off
if I wanted to be his best man.

95
00:14:09,969 --> 00:14:14,918
Can I kidnap him this weekend?
Drag him to the archipelago. A bachelor's party or something.

96
00:14:15,119 --> 00:14:17,693
Sure, do that.

97
00:14:18,699 --> 00:14:21,515
-Have you heard from dad by the way?
-Yes, everything's fine.

98
00:14:21,716 --> 00:14:25,015
-You haven't heard from him?
-No.

99
00:14:25,216 --> 00:14:27,348
OK.

100
00:14:30,848 --> 00:14:36,078
I'm meant to say hi from Frida by the way.
She's here this weekend with her school.

101
00:14:36,279 --> 00:14:39,538
She's doing a concert at Ã–stra Real.

102
00:14:40,463 --> 00:14:43,239
You can hang out then. It's cool.

103
00:14:50,641 --> 00:14:55,348
-I talked to Frida.
-Hm. She's all good?

104
00:14:58,446 --> 00:15:01,423
-Not really actually.
-Oh.

105
00:15:07,739 --> 00:15:12,405
-She is in love with your daughter.
-What did you say?

106
00:15:14,417 --> 00:15:19,526
-Come again?
-From what I gather, Mia has feelings for Frida too.

107
00:15:20,532 --> 00:15:24,756
-But Mia is engaged to Tim.
-Of course I know that, but...

108
00:15:25,802 --> 00:15:29,905
-So maybe she's bisexual.
-No, I don't think so.

109
00:15:30,106 --> 00:15:34,572
-Let's eat now. Sit down.
-Are you kidding?

110
00:15:36,221 --> 00:15:38,595
Haricot verts?

111
00:15:48,048 --> 00:15:53,922
So it's OK that my daughter is gay,
but not Mia?

112
00:15:54,123 --> 00:15:57,985
My daughter is not homosexual,
Elisabeth.

113
00:16:00,359 --> 00:16:05,910
-Maybe you think it's wrong, maybe you think it's a bit disgusting?
-Did I say that?

114
00:16:06,111 --> 00:16:10,577
-But it's not completely normal, right?
-No, it's not completely fucking normal, is it?

115
00:16:10,778 --> 00:16:15,445
No parents really want their child to be gay or lesbian,
if we're being honest, Elisabeth.

116
00:16:15,646 --> 00:16:18,261
So Frida isn't normal?

117
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:24,738
Lasse when Frida came out...

118
00:16:25,784 --> 00:16:28,720
...it wasn't easy, I admit.

119
00:16:28,921 --> 00:16:34,151
But today I'm very happy that she is who she is.

120
00:16:34,352 --> 00:16:39,663
That she stands up for who she is.
She wouldn't be my daughter otherwise.

121
00:16:39,864 --> 00:16:43,364
Let's not talk about this anymore. OK?

122
00:16:44,611 --> 00:16:47,950
How would that solve anything?

123
00:16:51,973 --> 00:16:53,984
Lasse?

124
00:16:57,243 --> 00:17:00,421
This is completely insane!

125
00:17:04,404 --> 00:17:07,381
Who the hell are you, really?

126
00:17:09,714 --> 00:17:12,530
What the hell are you thinking right now?

127
00:17:18,725 --> 00:17:20,898
No, God damn it!

128
00:20:09,459 --> 00:20:11,430
Mia?

129
00:20:19,797 --> 00:20:23,861
I shouldn't have come. I have to...I have to go.
Oskar couldn't make it, but he says hi.

130
00:20:24,062 --> 00:20:26,596
Wait, wait, wait, wait...

131
00:20:31,705 --> 00:20:37,418
Just give me five minutes, I'll send
the kids home with their parents.

132
00:20:38,464 --> 00:20:40,757
Wait for me.

133
00:20:41,964 --> 00:20:44,297
Don't go.

134
00:20:48,199 --> 00:20:51,418
I'm so happy you're here.

135
00:21:08,234 --> 00:21:10,728
Did you hide here, or what?

136
00:21:13,946 --> 00:21:18,331
I want to go away with you.
Far away.

137
00:21:21,147 --> 00:21:23,400
Do you want to?

138
00:23:37,364 --> 00:23:40,542
I think you've been lying a little bit to me.

139
00:23:45,932 --> 00:23:48,668
I'm hardly your first girl.

140
00:23:51,484 --> 00:23:54,421
No. Can you tell?

141
00:23:54,622 --> 00:23:57,277
Yes, you could say that.

142
00:24:00,415 --> 00:24:05,926
I thought about it on Fyn too.
Why haven't you told me?

143
00:24:06,128 --> 00:24:09,185
-Are you ashamed?
-No.

144
00:24:11,196 --> 00:24:15,581
I just didn't think I would feel like this again.

145
00:24:15,783 --> 00:24:18,558
Were you in love with her?

146
00:24:19,926 --> 00:24:25,116
-Will it make you jealous if I say yes?
-Eh, yes. Absolutely.

147
00:24:28,817 --> 00:24:31,512
-Does Tim know?
-No.

148
00:24:32,719 --> 00:24:35,294
It was much earlier.

149
00:24:36,581 --> 00:24:39,478
I've never cheated on him.

150
00:24:39,679 --> 00:24:41,650
Until now.

151
00:24:44,144 --> 00:24:48,207
I want to be with you all the time.

152
00:24:48,409 --> 00:24:52,311
I don't want to be just someone you cheat on Tim with.

153
00:25:17,173 --> 00:25:20,994
If I had the choice, I would build a house somewhere by the ocean.

154
00:25:22,322 --> 00:25:24,816
Andalusia.

155
00:25:25,017 --> 00:25:27,592
Or Catalonia.

156
00:25:29,322 --> 00:25:34,230
-I could live with you in a shoe box.
-Seriously?

157
00:25:34,431 --> 00:25:37,408
What if we did.

158
00:25:37,609 --> 00:25:42,477
Just take off, you and me.
And start over somewhere else.

159
00:25:46,701 --> 00:25:49,597
Why can't we start over here?

160
00:25:51,287 --> 00:25:54,546
Is that too realistic for you?

161
00:25:57,321 --> 00:25:59,574
Not romantic enough?

162
00:26:06,735 --> 00:26:08,706
But, Frida...

163
00:26:27,936 --> 00:26:29,907
Frida.

164
00:26:50,223 --> 00:26:55,171
I've never felt as strongly about anyone as I do about you in my entire life.

165
00:26:58,309 --> 00:27:01,045
But you just want to run away all the time.

166
00:27:05,792 --> 00:27:08,326
Start over?

167
00:27:11,062 --> 00:27:14,602
Do you know how much I'd want to do that.

168
00:27:19,550 --> 00:27:23,171
But you're getting married to Tim in three months.

169
00:27:24,820 --> 00:27:28,079
I am so stupid.

170
00:27:33,872 --> 00:27:36,607
What are you doing?

171
00:27:46,383 --> 00:27:48,837
Do you love him?

172
00:28:10,682 --> 00:28:13,498
You can't marry Tim.

173
00:28:15,187 --> 00:28:19,009
I won't be able to handle that.

174
00:29:24,502 --> 00:29:28,887
-Dad, did something happen?
-No, I just wanted to hear your voice.

175
00:29:30,496 --> 00:29:35,203
And...say thank you for the vase I got.
I'm not sure I did.

176
00:29:35,404 --> 00:29:37,899
OK. You're welcome.

177
00:29:38,824 --> 00:29:41,640
-Are you OK??
-Yes, I'm fine.

178
00:29:42,364 --> 00:29:46,588
I woke you up didn't I? I didn't realize
it was this late.

179
00:29:46,789 --> 00:29:51,094
-Let's hang up.
-OK.

180
00:29:51,818 --> 00:29:53,508
Fine.

181
00:29:54,312 --> 00:29:57,088
-Bye then.
-Bye.

182
00:30:43,714 --> 00:30:49,386
We could live like this, couldn't we?
This is almost like a shoe box.

183
00:30:59,685 --> 00:31:04,191
I wouldn't want to live like this.
It's not real.

184
00:31:04,392 --> 00:31:08,254
Shutting ourselves in a room miles away from everything.

185
00:31:13,484 --> 00:31:18,070
It's hard for me, Frida.
I'm not as brave as you.

186
00:31:21,047 --> 00:31:25,351
I just wish we didn't have to be questioned.

187
00:31:37,340 --> 00:31:40,880
I want them to ask.

188
00:31:41,081 --> 00:31:43,495
I'm proud of you.

189
00:31:44,983 --> 00:31:49,127
I want to show everyone how much I like you.

190
00:32:09,483 --> 00:32:12,339
-One o'clock at Mosebacke, then.
-Yes.

191
00:32:15,839 --> 00:32:17,810
Hey.

192
00:32:25,856 --> 00:32:30,764
I don't get any stubble, just some stuff.
I thought it looked OK.

193
00:33:10,591 --> 00:33:14,453
-I think I've known that about Mia the whole time.
-What?

194
00:33:16,304 --> 00:33:21,895
Yes, even though it only was suspicions
I had a hard time dealing with it.

195
00:33:24,028 --> 00:33:27,246
You know, when Frida told me...

196
00:33:28,654 --> 00:33:34,125
...I remember thinking, in a state of panic,
about everything I would miss out on.

197
00:33:34,326 --> 00:33:38,872
You know, wedding, becoming a grandmother,
all those things.

198
00:33:39,073 --> 00:33:42,694
But, hey...now I know better.

199
00:33:44,705 --> 00:33:46,677
Yes.

200
00:33:47,522 --> 00:33:51,303
I just want her to be fine.

201
00:35:24,917 --> 00:35:30,428
-I'm going to the city to take care of some things.
-Now? We're leaving soon.

202
00:35:32,721 --> 00:35:37,629
-What?
-To the church. You're the one who booked the meeting with the pastor at one.

203
00:36:06,554 --> 00:36:09,571
Well, well, you're nervous now, aren't you?

204
00:36:10,859 --> 00:36:17,778
Wedding ceremonies are actually over really quickly.
So I want you to really cherish the moment when you're up here with me.

205
00:36:17,979 --> 00:36:21,479
It goes like this:
first you say your vows to each other.

206
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:24,657
then I turn to you Tim.
And your full name.

207
00:36:24,858 --> 00:36:29,927
-Tim Aaron Bratthall.
-Tim Aaron, nice name, Bratthall.

208
00:36:30,128 --> 00:36:33,427
-Do you take this...
-Maria.

209
00:36:33,628 --> 00:36:39,743
You'll have to raise your voice for the real thing, so aunt Beda in the back can hear you too.
One more time, a little louder.

210
00:36:39,944 --> 00:36:42,197
Maria Eva SundstrÃ¶m.

211
00:36:42,398 --> 00:36:46,502
...Maria Eva SundstrÃ¶m
as your lawfully wedded wife?

212
00:36:46,703 --> 00:36:49,237
-Yes.
-And then we reverse it so it's your turn.

213
00:36:49,479 --> 00:36:53,381
And then the mandatory kiss.
Badabing, badabong.

214
00:36:53,582 --> 00:36:58,490
and then the mandatory kiss.
Till death do you part. Done.

215
00:37:02,996 --> 00:37:05,410
I can't.

216
00:37:11,243 --> 00:37:13,616
I'm sorry.

217
00:37:16,231 --> 00:37:21,300
She's just nervous, for sure.
Go talk to her and then come back.

218
00:37:21,501 --> 00:37:25,363
-This happens all the time. All the time.
-Mia!

219
00:37:27,536 --> 00:37:29,306
Oh my, oh my God.

220
00:37:29,507 --> 00:37:31,438
Mia!

221
00:37:36,145 --> 00:37:38,116
Mia!

222
00:37:39,484 --> 00:37:41,455
Mia!

223
00:37:55,012 --> 00:37:58,633
Frida! Frida!

224
00:38:07,282 --> 00:38:11,265
-So lucky, I thought you had left.
-Mia, I can't do this.

225
00:38:11,466 --> 00:38:15,409
I just left Tim in the church.
I can't marry him. I'm in love with you.

226
00:38:15,610 --> 00:38:18,587
But you're not done with him.

227
00:38:18,788 --> 00:38:21,443
You're not done with your life together.

228
00:38:21,644 --> 00:38:28,041
What happened today, when I sat there waiting for you because you were with him.
It will be like that all the time, won't it?

229
00:38:29,811 --> 00:38:34,638
I needed to wake up from this dream
with you and today I did.

230
00:38:34,839 --> 00:38:40,471
-Don't you understand what I sacrificed for us?
-Jesus Christ, you're not the only one making sacrifices.

231
00:38:41,960 --> 00:38:44,937
This isn't just about you.

232
00:38:49,603 --> 00:38:52,580
-Frida, please, don't go.
-But you're not fighting for this.

233
00:38:52,782 --> 00:38:56,965
-Yes I am, I'm here now.
-No, you're not!

234
00:39:01,672 --> 00:39:04,488
Frida, don't go. Frida!

235
00:39:37,275 --> 00:39:41,419
It's the wedding menus.
They just came.

236
00:39:41,620 --> 00:39:44,436
Done. Some timing.

237
00:39:45,723 --> 00:39:49,947
-I've looked everywhere for you.
-I have nothing to say to you.

238
00:39:52,522 --> 00:39:58,436
But I am thinking about what
to say to our families and our friends.

239
00:40:00,447 --> 00:40:04,189
"Regrettably, the wedding is cancelled."

240
00:40:06,763 --> 00:40:09,539
"Mia is apparently a dyke."

241
00:40:11,309 --> 00:40:14,809
How do you...how do you know?

242
00:40:17,585 --> 00:40:20,119
I saw you and Frida.

243
00:40:24,062 --> 00:40:25,872
You fucking asshole.

244
00:40:30,499 --> 00:40:34,441
I'm sorry you found out about it like this.

245
00:40:34,642 --> 00:40:36,412
Get out of here, damn it.

246
00:40:38,866 --> 00:40:41,521
Get the hell out of here, damn it!

247
00:40:41,723 --> 00:40:45,142
-Tim...
-Leave, damn it! Leave!

248
00:41:30,521 --> 00:41:36,515
I think the biggest reason Tim and I were getting married
was that everyone was expecting us to.

249
00:41:42,630 --> 00:41:45,285
Are you ashamed of me?

250
00:41:46,492 --> 00:41:50,796
I just want you to be happy and healthy.

251
00:42:00,854 --> 00:42:06,204
-Do you think it's my fault?
-Why does it have to be anyone's fault?

252
00:42:10,348 --> 00:42:13,083
Why Frida?

253
00:42:13,325 --> 00:42:16,100
Because I love her.

254
00:42:51,784 --> 00:42:53,755
Seven years, Mia.

255
00:42:57,738 --> 00:42:59,709
Seven years.

256
00:43:06,749 --> 00:43:11,255
I thought I knew who I was building a life with.

257
00:43:12,663 --> 00:43:15,238
I am so sorry, Tim.

258
00:43:17,008 --> 00:43:20,669
You don't exist to me anymore.

259
00:44:09,064 --> 00:44:11,800
I'm going to SkÃ¥ne with dad.

260
00:44:12,846 --> 00:44:15,702
I'll move out when I get back.

261
00:45:00,598 --> 00:45:03,133
-Hi.
-Is Frida here?

262
00:45:03,334 --> 00:45:07,236
-No, she's not here.
-Do you know where she is?

263
00:45:11,862 --> 00:45:13,914
Are you Mia?

264
00:45:14,115 --> 00:45:18,581
-Can you tell me where she is?
-Not on your life.

265
00:45:40,184 --> 00:45:43,563
Where is Frida?
Elisabeth, do you know where she is?

266
00:45:43,764 --> 00:45:47,103
She needs peace and quiet, Mia.

267
00:45:47,304 --> 00:45:50,684
And you're not exactly what I'd call peace and quiet to her right now.

268
00:45:50,885 --> 00:45:56,316
I have made a complete fool of myself, don't you understand that?
I have nothing left.

269
00:45:57,844 --> 00:46:01,063
If you know where she is,
please tell me - now.

270
00:46:10,678 --> 00:46:14,017
I really hope you know what you're doing.

271
00:46:18,040 --> 00:46:22,666
Let me see.
Her flight to Barcelona leaves in 40 minutes.

272
00:46:36,947 --> 00:46:38,919
Now go.

273
00:47:49,441 --> 00:47:55,757
Flight DY3656 to Barcelona
is departing from Gate 7.
